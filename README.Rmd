Identifying labeled compounds in a ^13^C-tracer experiment in non-targeted fashion 
is a cumbersome process. This package facilitates such type of analyses by 
providing high level quality control plots, spectra deconvolution and evaluation 
and performing a multitude of tests in an automatic fashion. The main idea is 
to use changing intensity ratios of ion pairs from a peak list, generated with 
i.e. `xcms`, as candidates and evaluate those against base peak chromatograms 
and spectra information within the raw measurement data automatically. The 
functionality is described in this [scientific article](https://doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00356).

## Installation

You can install the development version of HiResTEC using:
